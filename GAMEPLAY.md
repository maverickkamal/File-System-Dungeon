## Mechanics

### 1. Exploration & Combat
*   **Rooms**: Each folder is a room. Entering a new room grants **Exploration XP**.
*   **Enemies**: Files are enemies.
    *   **HP**: Determined by file size. Larger files = More HP. 
    *   **Type**:
        *   **Constructs** (`.py`, `.js`): balances fighters.
        *   **Illusions** (`.png`, `.jpg`): Weak but numerous.
        *   **Lore** (`txt`, `.md`): Can be read for knowledge.
        *   **Bosses** (`.exe`): High HP and dangerous.
*   **Combat**: Turn-based. You attack, then the enemy attacks.
    *   **Victory**: Grants XP and "Loot" (Essence).
    *   **Defeat**: You respawn at max HP (Death penalty coming soon).
    *   **Run**: Escape combat safely.

### 2. Progression
*   **XP**: Earned by exploring rooms, defeating enemies, and reading Lore.
*   **Level Up**: Restores HP and increases Max HP.

### 3. Lore Systemm
*   Encountering a **Lore** file (`.txt`, `.md`, etc.) enables the **READ** button in combat.
*   Reading a file grants significant **XP** ("Ancient Knowledge").
*   Use this to level up quickly!

### 4. Color Codes
*   **Blue**: Code / Constructs
*   **Magenta**: Image / Illusions
*   **Yellow**: text / Lore
*   **Red**: Executables / Bosses
*   **Green**: Directories / Portals

1. **Find a large `.txt` file** and use the **Read** button to gain massive XP.
2. **Battle an `.exe` Boss** (careful!) to test your strength.
