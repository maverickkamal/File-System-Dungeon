# File System Dungeon 

**Trun your file system into a dungeon crawler RPG!**

File System Dungeon is a terminal-based RPG where your folders are rooms, files are enemies, and your hard drive is the world map. Explore your computer, battle "Constructs" (code), "Illusions" (images), and "Bosses" (executables), and loot them for XP and glory.

## Features

*   **Explore Real Directories**: Navigate your actual file system as a dungeon map.
*   **Turn-Based Combat**: Fight files based on their size and type.
*   **RPG Progression**: gain XP, level up, and increase your HP.
*   **Inventory System**: Loot the essence of defeated files.
*   **Lore System**: Read text files to gain "Ancient Knowledge" (XP).
*   **Safe**: Defeated files are marked in the save files, **NOT** deleted from your disk.
